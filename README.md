==============
The project now uses yeoman.io and Angular.js.

To get started with the project you'll need to install yeoman.io which you can find out how to do [here](http://yeoman.io/gettingstarted.html).

Alternatively you can do as follows to setup (after cloning):
* Globally install yo/grunt/bower: `npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower`
* Install node_modules: `npm install`
* Install packages: `bower install` (On Windows, run bower install from the Git Shell)
* Install Ruby: For Windows install: http://rubyinstaller.org/. Run `ruby -v` to check install. 
* Install Compass: `gem update --system && gem install compass`
* Run test server: `grunt server`
*   Note: If 'bower install' is giving git errors 127 or 128, try 'bower install -f' to dump the cache before install.
